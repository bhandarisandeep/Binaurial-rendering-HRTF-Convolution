# Binaurial-rendering-HRTF-Convolution
It is a sample code how we can integrate the two or more audio sample to create a Spatial Binaural rendered sound which can give the spatial audio immersive experience altogether.

I have added the pyhthon file for multiple input:

Steps:

First extract the folder and then,
copy the "Multiple" pyhthon file in it and run.

PS: I have kept a requirements file as well, in case no virtual envirmnent setup is possible.
